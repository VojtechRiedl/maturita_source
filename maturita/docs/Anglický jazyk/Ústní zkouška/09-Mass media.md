# Mass Media, Means of Communication

## 1. Communication in the Past
- People in the past had limited means of communication. They could speak to each other, send messages through smoke signals, use mail, and later, newspapers became common.
- The first major expansion of media occurred with the invention of radio and television. The most significant advancement came in the 1960s with the launch of the first communication satellite.
- There are four main types of media: Newspapers, TV, Radio, and the Internet. Today, media plays a crucial role in our lives, providing us with vast amounts of information.

## 2. Media Impact
- Media has made our world much smaller. With TV and the Internet, we can instantly connect with the global community, learn about different cultures, and see current events worldwide.
- However, there are downsides to media. False information exists, and there is a risk of negative influence, such as exposure to pornography or violent content. Also, famous individuals often face privacy intrusion by the media.

## 3. Newspapers
- Despite being the oldest form of media, newspapers are somewhat old-fashioned today. They lack flexibility as breaking news isn't available until the next day.
- However, newspapers still hold a charm. People enjoy the calmness of reading them, especially with a cup of coffee in a peaceful setting like a garden.

## 4. Radio
- Radio, the second oldest form of media, remains popular due to its portability and versatility.
- It's widely used for music and relaxation, and it's convenient as background noise. Radio provides quick updates on events, and modern receivers allow users to select preferred programs.

## 5. TV
- TV is the most widespread media, known for its strong influence with moving images. With communication satellites, viewers have a wide range of programming options.
- TV heavily relies on advertisements for revenue, leading to debates about their frequency and honesty.

## 6. The Internet
- The Internet offers vast, fast, and global access to information, surpassing TV. However, it comes at a cost, requiring fees for internet service and potentially high equipment costs.
- Despite the expenses, the internet provides an abundance of resources for those who know how to navigate it.
